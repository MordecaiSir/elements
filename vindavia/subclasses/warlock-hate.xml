			<p><em>6th-level The Ancient Scribe feature</em></p>
			<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to inscribe powerful seals onto creatures, marking them with the weight of cosmic knowledge. You can place a Seal of Judgment or a Seal of Truth on a creature as a bonus action. A creature can only have one seal at a time, and a seal lasts for 1 minute or until it is triggered.</p>
			<p>Seal of Judgment: When the marked creature targets you with an attack or harmful ability, you can use your reaction to detonate the seal, dealing 2d8 psychic damage to the creature.</p>
			<p>Seal of Truth: The marked creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, for the next 10 minutes, the creature cannot knowingly lie. Unlike Zone of Truth, this does not create an aura; it only affects the marked creature, and the creature is aware of the effect.</p>
			<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses after a long rest.</p>
