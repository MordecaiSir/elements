		<supports>Primal Path</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Barbarians who walk the Path of Hatred are driven by an unrelenting fury, fueled by the wrongs they've endured and the desire to protect what remains dear to them. Their rage is not just an expression of emotion but a destructive force that bends their body and mind to a single purpose: the annihilation of those who stand in their way. Every strike, every wound, only serves to intensify their wrath, pushing them beyond the limits of pain and endurance.</p>
            <p>These warriors care little for their own safety, throwing themselves into battle with reckless abandon. Their hatred manifests as a primal force, granting them brutal power, but at a terrible cost. They are relentless, driven by a single goal—eradication of their enemies at all costs. The pain they endure in battle only sharpens their focus, and their presence on the battlefield draws the attention of all who would dare to challenge them.</p>
            <p>Barbarians on this path are the embodiment of vengeance and fury. Their rage is their shield, their weapon, and their curse, making them formidable foes and unyielding protectors of those they care about.</p>
