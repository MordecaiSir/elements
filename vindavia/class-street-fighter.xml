		<description>
			<p>A human in tattered clothes delivers a flurry of punches to a thug in a dark alley. A half-orc with scarred fists grapples a foe to the ground, striking with ruthless precision. An elf in loose wraps dances around her opponent, landing devastating kicks. These are Street Fighters, warriors forged in the crucible of urban brawls and underground cages. Masters of unarmed combat, they wield their bodies as weapons, blending raw power, cunning, and instinct. Whether a disciplined boxer, a scrappy street dog, a fluid Muay Thai artist, a brutal MMA-inspired hound, or a savage beast, Street Fighters thrive in chaos, facing danger with grit and skill.</p>
			<h4>URBAN WARRIORS</h4>
			<p>Street Fighters excel in close-quarters combat, using fists, kicks, elbows, and improvised weapons. They are not bound by formal training but by hard-earned experience in unpredictable environments. Each Street Fighter specializes in a unique style, from stunning punches to tactical improvisation, making them versatile in any brawl.</p>
			<h4>FORGED IN CONFLICT</h4>
			<p>Not every street thug or tavern brawler is a Street Fighter. Only those who have endured countless fights, honed their instincts, and mastered their craft rise to this level. They might be pit fighters, gang enforcers, or self-taught survivors, but all share a knack for turning any situation to their advantage.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A STREET FIGHTER</h4>
			<p>Consider your character’s origins: Where did you learn to fight? In a boxing ring, a back alley, or an underground cage? What drives you—revenge, survival, or glory? Were you mentored by a grizzled veteran, or did you claw your way up through sheer will? Your scars, tattoos, or fighting stance might reflect your past, shaping how you approach combat and the world.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you focus on powerful strikes or agile maneuvers. Constitution should be your next-highest score for durability. Choose the Urchin or Criminal background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
